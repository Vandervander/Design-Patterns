README:
This is a part of a small revision project based around these videos by Christopher Okhravi at www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrhzvIcii6GNjpARdnO4ueTUAVR9eMBpc

I re-explore basic java functionality at the same time as I re-familiarise myself with design patterns (in object-oriented programming).

I started this slightly out-of-order, and this one is incomplete.
I'm relatively verbose in commenting, though I did divide these files up quite a lot (I forgot that making classes non-public lets you put multiple classes in one file).
On the upside, it has resulted in a very clean layout - irregularly divided as it is - and it has scaffolded my documentation.
