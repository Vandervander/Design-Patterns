README:
This a small revision project based around these videos by Christopher Okhravi at www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrhzvIcii6GNjpARdnO4ueTUAVR9eMBpc

I re-explore basic java functionality at the same time as I re-familiarise myself with design patterns (in object-oriented programming).

This will likely be slow to progress, as I find a regular time to commit to writing my way through this project, but it will be doing it nonetheless.
